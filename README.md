# doorbell-to-web
Doorbell connected to Particle core sending an pushbullet notification by the web

Together with a friend we created a simple doorbell. I am not a coder, but sometimes I like to do simple coding tasks to create my own project such as a doorbell which sends me a notification to my smartphone and wearables (Smartwatch and Google Glass). So with copy/paste from current scripts in the Particle community I was able to get it done, and like to share it.
